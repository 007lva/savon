Savon logs each request and response to STDOUT. Specifying your own logger is as easy as it gets:

  Savon::Request.logger = RAILS_DEFAULT_LOGGER

The default log level is set to :debug. In case you need to change this:

  Savon::Request.log_level = :info

You can also disable logging if you need to:

  Savon::Request.log = false
