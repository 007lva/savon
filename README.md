## Version 3

**Status: Unstable.** Savon version 3 is currently under development and available for testing on GitHub.  
Use this version if you can handle changes and want to provide feedback.

Version 3 is still in a very early stage, but [there is some documentation!](http://savonrb.com/version3/)

## Stable version

If you're looking for the latest stable version, please [check out the version2 branch](https://github.com/savonrb/savon/tree/version2).  
There's also a [version1 branch](https://github.com/savonrb/savon/tree/version2), for everyone stuck on that version.


## Maintainer needed

So I've been maintaining Savon and its dependant projects for the last four years and it's become quite  
apparent now with my schedule I do not have the time to keep this project going single-handed.

Luckily there are numerous people helping out from time to time, but maintaining this project is pretty  
much a full-time job and it keeps me from working on the next major version.

I'll be able to contribute on a small scale going forward, and will do my best in the meantime to catch  
up with everything I am behind on.

If you are interested, please email me at [me at rubiii dot com].  
I'll do everything I can to help you get started.


## Give back
